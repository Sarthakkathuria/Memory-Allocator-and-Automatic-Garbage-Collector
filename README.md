# Memory Allocation and Garbage Collection
In this project, we've created our own malloc function from Scratch
Here, a memory block array is initialized, and the data is stored inside the memory block array.

To run this project, download the ```proj.c``` file, and run it on your terminal using 
```gcc proj.c```
```./a.out```
